## ðŸ’» What this simple app does: 
This single-file web app lets anyone build a price target heatmap for any stock by entering a ticker and an FMP API key. It calls FMPâ€™s Price Target News endpoint to collect recent analyst targets and renders them as a color-scaled row so highs/lows pop at a glance, plus shows min / max / average / standard deviation. It also queries Financial Estimates (annual EPS and Revenue) and draws a second heatmap with forward years as columns to highlight trends. Everything runs client-side with vanilla HTML/CSS/JSâ€”no libraries, installs, or build tools. Itâ€™s a fast way for investors, PMs, and executives to visualize dispersion and fundamentals in seconds.
